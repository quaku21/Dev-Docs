# 🛠️ DevOps & Self-Hosting Guides

This repository contains a growing collection of **clear, battle-tested guides** for software developers and engineers who manage their own infrastructure or self-hosted tools.

Whether you're deploying apps like **n8n**, setting up **NGINX reverse proxies**, configuring **Docker containers**, or enabling **SSL with Certbot**, these docs are written for real-world use cases — especially when you’re working on production servers that already run other applications.

## 📚 Contents

- `n8n-nginx-certbot.md` — How to self-host n8n on a live Ubuntu server using Docker, NGINX, and Certbot without Caddy

*(More guides coming soon — on Meilisearch, Ghost, Uptime monitoring, Docker hardening, etc.)*

## 🧩 Why This Repo?

There’s a gap between quick-start tutorials and actual production environments. This repo is for:

- Developers who run multiple services on the same server
- Engineers who use NGINX as a central reverse proxy
- Teams looking for SSL-secure, containerized deployments
- People who want infrastructure that doesn’t break existing apps
